# Tsoha-project

## Forum

The subject of the project is a forum. Just a simple forum that one can log into and make/view posts and commend etc.

## Database

The database will be PostgreSQL-based database.

### Tables (at least)
* posts
* users
* topics (?)
* areas (?)

### Fancier db things
* authenticated user can add posts and edit the old ones
* other boring user/account things
* can sort posts by area or topic or something
* rest of the details will come, I changed the subject on Sunday

## Deployment

The site is being deployed at https://tsoha-flask.fly.dev/
